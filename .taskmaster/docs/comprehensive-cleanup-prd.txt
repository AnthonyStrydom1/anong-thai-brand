# Product Requirements Document: Anthony_Anong Project Comprehensive Cleanup & Security Audit

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Anthony_Anong React/TypeScript Application Cleanup
**Project Type:** Web Application (React + TypeScript + Supabase)
**Current Status:** Development/Maintenance Phase
**Project Path:** C:\Github\Anthony_Anong

## Executive Summary

This project involves the comprehensive cleanup, security hardening, and optimization of a React/TypeScript web application. The application uses modern web technologies including Vite, Supabase, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS. Critical security vulnerabilities have been identified and partially resolved, with systematic cleanup required across all project areas.

## Current Project State Analysis

### Architecture
- **Frontend:** React 18.3.1 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Framework:** shadcn/ui + Radix UI components + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Supabase (Database + Auth + Edge Functions)
- **Mobile:** Capacitor for mobile app deployment
- **State Management:** TanStack Query + React Hook Form
- **Routing:** React Router DOM

### Critical Issues Identified (COMPLETED ✅)
1. **Security Vulnerability:** Supabase service role key was exposed in version control
   - Status: ✅ RESOLVED - Credentials rotated, environment secured
   - New secure credentials implemented
   - Git tracking for .env files fixed

2. **Package Manager Conflicts:** Mixed npm/bun lock files
   - Status: ✅ RESOLVED - Standardized on npm
   - Dependency vulnerabilities audited and addressed

### Ongoing Cleanup Requirements

#### High Priority Security Items
1. **Git History Cleanup:** Remove historical credential exposure
2. **Security Headers Implementation:** Comprehensive security middleware
3. **Authentication Flow Audit:** Review and harden auth processes
4. **CORS and API Security:** Production-ready security configuration

#### Code Quality and Maintenance
1. **TODO/FIXME Resolution:** 6+ identified code comments requiring attention
2. **Error Handling Standardization:** Inconsistent error patterns
3. **Testing Infrastructure:** Minimal test coverage currently
4. **Code Structure Optimization:** Some organizational improvements needed

#### Performance and Optimization
1. **Bundle Size Analysis:** Large dependency footprint needs review
2. **Performance Monitoring:** No current observability infrastructure
3. **Mobile Optimization:** Capacitor configuration needs review
4. **Accessibility Compliance:** WCAG 2.1 compliance audit required

## Technical Requirements

### Security Requirements (Critical)
- [ ] Complete git history sanitization
- [ ] Implement comprehensive security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- [ ] Set up git-secrets for credential prevention
- [ ] Configure rate limiting and request validation
- [ ] Implement security monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessment

### Code Quality Requirements (High)
- [ ] Resolve all TODO/FIXME/BUG comments in codebase
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling patterns
- [ ] Set up automated testing infrastructure (Jest + React Testing Library)
- [ ] Configure ESLint/Prettier with strict rules and pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Implement TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] Achieve 85%+ test coverage for critical paths

### Performance Requirements (Medium)
- [ ] Bundle size optimization (target <1MB initial load)
- [ ] Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring (Core Web Vitals)
- [ ] Optimize build process and deployment pipeline
- [ ] Implement proper caching strategies
- [ ] Progressive Web App (PWA) optimization

### Infrastructure Requirements (Medium)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- [ ] Implement environment configuration validation
- [ ] Configure monitoring and observability stack
- [ ] Set up automated dependency scanning
- [ ] Create deployment automation and rollback procedures

### Documentation Requirements (Low)
- [ ] Comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Developer onboarding and setup guides
- [ ] Architecture and design decision documentation
- [ ] Security and deployment runbooks

## Success Criteria

### Security Metrics
- Zero high/critical vulnerabilities in dependency scan
- All historical credentials removed from git history
- Security headers score >90% on securityheaders.com
- Penetration testing shows no exploitable vulnerabilities

### Code Quality Metrics
- All TODO/FIXME comments resolved
- ESLint score: 0 errors, <10 warnings
- TypeScript strict mode: 0 compiler errors
- Test coverage: >85% for critical business logic

### Performance Metrics
- Initial page load: <3 seconds on 3G
- Bundle size: <1MB gzipped initial load
- Lighthouse score: >90% across all categories
- Core Web Vitals: All metrics in "Good" range

### Developer Experience Metrics
- Setup time for new developer: <30 minutes
- Build time: <60 seconds
- CI/CD pipeline: <5 minutes end-to-end
- Zero-config development environment

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Git History Exposure:** Historical credentials still in git history
- **Authentication Vulnerabilities:** Auth flow needs security review
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Some dev dependencies have known issues

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Issues:** Large bundle size may impact user experience
- **Code Maintainability:** Technical debt in error handling and structure
- **Testing Gaps:** Limited test coverage creates deployment risk

### Low Risk
- **Documentation Debt:** Limited impact on functionality
- **Mobile Optimization:** Nice-to-have improvements
- **Accessibility Gaps:** Important but not blocking

## Project Timeline Estimate
