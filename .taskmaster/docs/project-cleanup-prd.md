- Authentication/authorization review
- Dependency vulnerability fixes

### Phase 3: Code Quality & Structure (Priority: HIGH)
**Timeline: 5-7 days**
- Resolve all TODO/FIXME comments
- Standardize project structure
- Implement error handling
- Set up testing infrastructure

### Phase 4: Performance & Optimization (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Timeline: 7-10 days**

- Performance validation
- User acceptance testing

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Credential Exposure**: Immediate security threat requiring urgent action
- **Git History**: May contain historical sensitive data exposure
- **Production Deployment**: Current codebase not production-ready

### Medium Risk
- **Technical Debt**: May slow down future development
- **Testing Coverage**: Lack of tests increases regression risk
- **Performance**: May impact user experience

### Low Risk
- **Documentation**: Affects developer onboarding but not functionality
- **Mobile Optimization**: Secondary to core web functionality

## Dependencies and Constraints

### External Dependencies
- Supabase service availability
- GitHub repository access
- Package registry availability (npm/yarn)

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing functionality during cleanup
- Cannot break existing user data or sessions
- Must maintain compatibility with Lovable platform

### Resource Constraints
- Single developer working on cleanup
- Must prioritize security over feature development
- Limited testing resources for mobile platforms

## Quality Assurance Plan

### Testing Strategy
1. **Automated Testing**
   - Unit tests for all utilities and business logic
   - Component tests for UI components
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - E2E tests for critical user journeys

2. **Security Testing**
   - Automated security scanning (OWASP ZAP)
   - Manual penetration testing
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Lighthouse audits
   - Load testing for backend APIs
   - Mobile performance testing

### Code Review Process
1. All changes must pass automated checks
2. Security-critical changes require additional review
3. Performance impact assessment for significant changes
