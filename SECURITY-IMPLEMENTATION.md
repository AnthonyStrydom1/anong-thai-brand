# Security Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Anthony_Anong project backend API. These measures protect against common web application vulnerabilities and follow industry best practices.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Security Headers

**Content Security Policy (CSP)**
- Implemented nonce-based CSP to prevent XSS attacks
- Removed 'unsafe-inline' from script-src directive
- Comprehensive directives for all resource types
- Dynamic nonce generation per request

**Additional Security Headers**
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Browser XSS protection
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information
- `Strict-Transport-Security` - Enforces HTTPS connections
- `Permissions-Policy` - Restricts browser features

**Privacy and Anti-Fingerprinting**
- `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: off` - Disables DNS prefetching
- `X-Download-Options: noopen` - Prevents automatic file opening
- Removal of `X-Powered-By` and `Server` headers

### 2. Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection

**Enhanced Rate Limiting**
- Progressive penalties for repeat offenders
- IP-based tracking with suspicious activity detection
- Automatic blocking of malicious IPs
- Configurable limits per time window

**Request Timing Protection**
- 30-second timeout for slow requests
- Protection against slow loris attacks
- Automatic cleanup of hanging connections

### 3. Input Validation and Sanitization

**XSS Prevention**
- Comprehensive script tag removal
- JavaScript protocol blocking
- Event handler attribute stripping
- Style injection prevention

**SQL Injection Protection**
- Pattern-based SQL injection detection
- Keyword filtering for dangerous SQL commands
- Comment and union attack prevention

**Path Traversal Protection**
- Directory traversal pattern detection
- System file access prevention
- Encoded path traversal detection

**Template Injection Prevention**
- Template syntax detection and blocking
- Variable interpolation protection

### 4. CORS Configuration

**Origin Validation**
- Environment-based allowed origins
- Production vs development origin lists
- Explicit origin checking with logging
- Preflight cache optimization

### 5. HTTPS and Transport Security

**HTTPS Enforcement**
- Automatic redirect to HTTPS in production
- HSTS header with includeSubDomains
- Preload list inclusion ready

### 6. Authentication and Authorization

**JWT Security**
- Proper token validation
- User context extraction
- Role-based access control
- Service role vs anon key separation

### 7. Security Monitoring and Logging

**Security Event Logging**
- Comprehensive event tracking
- Client identification and tracking
- Attack pattern detection
- Audit trail maintenance

**Monitored Events**
- Rate limit violations
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS attempts
- Path traversal attempts
- Suspicious IP activity
- Authentication failures

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Required security-related environment variables:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production  # Enables HTTPS enforcement

# CORS Configuration
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### Security Middleware Stack

The security middleware is applied in the following order:

1. **HTTPS Enforcement** - Redirects HTTP to HTTPS in production
2. **Request Timing** - Implements request timeouts
3. **Security Headers** - Applies all security headers including CSP with nonce
4. **Enhanced Rate Limiting** - Rate limiting with threat detection
5. **CORS** - Cross-origin request handling
6. **Enhanced Input Validation** - Comprehensive input sanitization

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Tests

Run the security test suite:

```bash
cd backend
node security-test.js
```

The test suite validates:
- Security header implementation
- Rate limiting functionality
- Input validation effectiveness
- CORS configuration
- CSP implementation
- Authentication security

### Manual Security Testing

**Rate Limiting Test**
```bash
# Test rate limiting with multiple requests
for i in {1..110}; do curl http://localhost:5000/health; done
```

**Input Validation Test**
```bash
# Test XSS protection
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/contact \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"<script>alert(\"xss\")</script>","email":"test@test.com"}'

# Test SQL injection protection
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/contact \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"'"'"'; DROP TABLE users; --","email":"test@test.com"}'
```

**Security Headers Test**
```bash
# Check security headers
curl -I http://localhost:5000/health
```

## Security Incident Response

### Monitoring and Alerting

Security events are logged with the following format:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-18T17:30:00.000Z",
  "event": "sql_injection_attempt",
  "clientId": "192.168.1.100",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "url": "/api/contact",
  "method": "POST",
  "details": {
    "field": "message",
    "value": "'; DROP TABLE users; --"
  }
}
```

### Response Procedures

1. **Rate Limit Violations**: Automatic IP blocking for 1 hour after 5 violations
2. **SQL Injection Attempts**: Request blocked, event logged, client tracked
3. **XSS Attempts**: Input sanitized, event logged for monitoring
4. **Path Traversal**: Request blocked, security team notified

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Security Tasks

1. **Weekly**: Review security logs for patterns
2. **Monthly**: Update dependency security patches
3. **Quarterly**: Security audit and penetration testing
4. **Annually**: Full security architecture review

### Security Monitoring

- Monitor error logs for security events
- Track rate limiting violations
- Review blocked IP addresses
- Analyze attack patterns

## Best Practices

### Development

1. Never commit credentials to version control
2. Use environment variables for all configuration
3. Test security features in development
4. Run security tests before deployment

### Production

1. Enable HTTPS with valid certificates
2. Configure proper CORS origins
3. Monitor security logs regularly
4. Keep dependencies updated

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Credential Exposure**: Rotate immediately using Supabase dashboard
2. **Security Breach**: Block malicious IPs, review logs, patch vulnerabilities
3. **DDoS Attack**: Scale rate limiting, enable DDoS protection services

## Compliance and Standards

This implementation follows:
- OWASP Top 10 security practices
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Industry standard security headers
- Modern web security best practices

## Future Enhancements

Planned security improvements:
1. Web Application Firewall (WAF) integration
2. Advanced threat detection with machine learning
3. Real-time security dashboard
4. Automated incident response
5. Security metrics and reporting
